# CST8100-Assignment-1
This was my first assignment I created at Algonquin College. All it required was a user enter five numbers without spaces and have the program display each number on a separate line. It does not handle invalid input other than if more or less than five numbers were entered.

The purpose of this assignment was to introduce user input,the while loop, and displaying text on multiple lines and seeing how the modulus works.
