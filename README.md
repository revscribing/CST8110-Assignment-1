# CST8110 Assignment #1 - Arithmetic and Loops
This was my first assignment I created in my "Intro to Computer Programming" course at Algonquin College. Written in Java, it simply required a user to enter five numbers without spaces and have the program display each number on a separate line. It does not handle invalid input other than if more or less than five numbers were entered.

The purpose of this assignment was to introduce user input,the while loop, and displaying text on multiple lines and seeing how the modulus works.
